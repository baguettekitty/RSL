Specific Characters (DRAFT)

Keys

TBD: To be decided
Initiate & End Alphabetical Characters (1): Jump 2 or 3x
Initiate & End Special Characters (2): Jump 4x

Once initiated (Polybius Method & Special Characters):

	360 spin = 0
	W = 1
	A = 2
	S = 3
	D = 4

A polybius square will be used for characters as follows:

Methods of Extraction and Conversion
		
Alphabetical Characters (1)
	
There are two ways to convert to letters in (1):
	
Method 1 (Standard Polybius Square Cipher)
	
	To initiate this method, the player will jump 2 times. Using Row-Column precedence, i.e., you start with the number in the row, then the number in the column, you locate the desired letter in the square. 
	E.g, 1-4 = K, 2-1 = M, 4-3 = Y.
	Once a player has finished their letter (after two movements), their confirmation is assumed and they should move to the next letter

	

Method 2 (Anchor Numbers)

	To initiate this method, the player will jump 3 times. First the player will select the desired number to obtain a specific anchor number. Then, the player will jump, with each jump counting down the alphabet by one. (Iterating down the polybius square in base 4) Once the player has reached the desired letter, they may turn their character any direction to confirm the letter.
		E.g (2)++++ = P, (0)++++++ = G, (3)++ = S, (4) = V 
	Each + denotes an iteration, counting down the alphabet by 1 letter.


Special Characters (2)

	To initiate this method, the player will jump 4 times. Using Row-Column precedence, i.e., you start with the number in the row, then the number in the column, you 	locate the desired letter in the square. 
	E.g, 1-0 =  5,  1-1 = 6, 1-4 = 9
	Once a player has finished their letter (after two movements), their confirmation is assumed and they should move to the next letter


Memorization Methods and Tricks
	
- To remember W = 1, A = 2, S = 3, D = 4, recall the phrase (WASD), and compare the orders: (W, A, S, D) → (1, 2, 3, 4)

- Remembering anchor numbers is very important, and the memorization process shouldn’t take more than 2 minutes. After this, make sure you can effectively count down the alphabet from each anchor number.

- In the Special Characters (2), each number’s position is its base 5 representation. For instance, since 115 = 1* 5 + 1 = 6, then 1-1. Similarly, since 045 = 0*5 + 4 = 4, 0-4 = 4.
