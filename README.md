## Roblox Sign Language (RSL)

Roblox Sign Language (RSL) is a replacement for chatting due to the new Roblox age verfication requirement to chat

- It is very messy and bare bones right now, but it will hopefully evolve into something better

- Unsure if affected will be able to emote (/e dance). This might cause problems due to heavy reliance on them for quick chat.


## Examples for quick chat:

"360 spin + /e dance1 + sideways back and forth" = can we play a game? (we play game?)

- Then they could answer with "shake head" or "/e cheer" = no, yes (negative, positive)

"360 spin + turn back and forth, /e point at person" = who is that (what that)

"/e dance1 + 90 degree turn + sideways back and forth" = let's play another game (we other game)
